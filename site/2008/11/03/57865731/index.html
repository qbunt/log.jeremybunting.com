    <p>So, tomorrow is probably the most important election of my lifetime.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care who you vote for.  Just please, for the sake of the country you live in, go out and vote.  There&#8217;s no reason not to, it&#8217;s not hard, and it helps preserve the foundations this country was founded on. Your vote <i>counts</i>, no matter how much you don&#8217;t think it will. </p>

<p>You can find out where your polling place is <a href="http://www.voteforchange.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>If you vote once in your lifetime, tomorrow would be the best time for it.</p>

<p>Just so you know, I&#8217;ve never really been involved in politics, never openly said anything publicly about politics.  Make your voice heard. VOTE dammit.</p>
