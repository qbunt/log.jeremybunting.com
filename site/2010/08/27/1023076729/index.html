The tablet&#8217;s been great for fine manipulation in things like Flash and Photoshop, but not really a prime device for navigating around the file system, so I resorted to the stock Mighty Mouse for basically everything else.</p>

<p>The Mighty Mouse is terrible in basically every way.</p>

<p>I took the plunge and started looking for a primary mouse that would be worthy of holding for more than 40 hours a week.  If I kept using the Mighty Mouse, I would eventually end up with a horrendous claw for a hand, which, I would have to swap out for a pirate hook.  Not only was the Mighty Mouse not really an ergonomic shape, but the scroll ball is&#8230;the worst. Sometimes it&#8217;d be great in going one direction, and just fail to function normally in other direction.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/devices/5845">Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a> has been a brilliant replacement. Wireless, but able to be charged while you use it, very good scroll wheel, and most importantly, it&#8217;s comfortable to use for long hours. Also, one great thumb button.</p>

<p>For those still gripping the stinking soap bar impersonator, the Mighty Mouse, there are much better options out there by <em>far</em>.</p>
