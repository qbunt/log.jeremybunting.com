<p><strong><a href="http://swipely.com">Swipely</a></strong><br/> I’m excited to share a project that we’ve been working on for the better part of a year. Swipely is a great new way to share your purchases, recommend places and products to you friends, and save money. To get started, you can link your account with your credit card or simply email your receipts from almost any merchant. You can choose which swipes you share, and also automate certain types of purchases. For instance, if you go to the same coffee shop every day, Swipely will automatically share it with your friends.</p>

<p>There’s nothing more satisfying than pulling back the red curtain on a project you’ve been working on for months, and I couldn’t be happier with how things have turned out. We’ve been working closely with <a href="http://angusdavis.com">Angus</a> and his team since day one, and it feels incredible to finally share it with everyone.</p>

<p>Swipely is currently in invite-only beta, but if you enter your email we’ll be sending out invitations in the coming weeks. <a href="http://swipely.com">Sign Up Here</a></p>

<p>Super innovative concept, I haven&#8217;t seen any other company executing this quite to this level.  Well done!</p>
