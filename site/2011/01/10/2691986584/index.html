    <blockquote>Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir menâ€™s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a>, architect (1864-1912) - The man that built some of the worlds first skyscrapers and created urban plans for Chicago, Washington DC, San Francisco, Cleveland, and Manila <em>before the profession of urban planning existed</em>.
