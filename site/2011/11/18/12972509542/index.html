<h2><strong>PROTECT IP Act Breaks the Internet</strong></h2>

<p>PROTECT-IP is dangerous bill that is up for discussion in congress today, and it has the power to cripple internet startups and vastly change the open nature of the internet.  PROTECT IP essentially gives the entertainment industry to censor, enforce, and sue any person, company or ISP that allows access to copyrighted material.  With the way that the bill is written this will put people singing an <em>acapella rendition of their favorite pop song</em> in the legal cross hairs of the entertainment industry in the same way that it would for a file sharing site.</p>

<p>Protecting copyrights and piracy are important issues that need to be dealt with, but <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s968rs/pdf/BILLS-112s968rs.pdf">PROTECT-IP</a> and <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf">SOPA</a> will drastically change the was we enjoy and do business on the internet for the negative.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/protect-the-net">Tumblr’s efforts to get people to call congress</a>, I had a great conversation with my local representative <a href="http://garymiller.house.gov/">Gary Miller’s</a> office.  Take the two minutes it takes to voice your opinion.  Simply fill out your phone number, address and zip code and Tumblr will call your phone connecting you directly to your representative’s office.</p>
