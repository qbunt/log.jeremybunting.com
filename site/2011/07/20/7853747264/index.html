    <p>From the <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/905/cpsid_90508.html#main_Flash_Builder">source</a>.</p>

<p>Flash Builder 4.0.x will not work on Mac OS X 10.7. Adobe does not intend to update this product for use on Mac OS X 10.7.</p>

<p>Flash Builder 4.5 is generally compatible with Mac OS X Lion; however, we have discovered issues that may degrade the user experience or affect use of the products. We do not recommend that these customers upgrade to Mac OS X 10.7.Â </p>



<p>So what then, Adobe, do you suggest for the future of Flash Builder? Hope? Unicorns?</p>

<p>Way to leave users exactly one version behind completely screwed. $2,799 for Master Collection doesn&#8217;t seem worth it at all in hind sight.</p>
