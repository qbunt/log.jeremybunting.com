<a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/06/03/nook-simple-touch-review">Nook Simple Touch compared to Kindle 3 – Marco.org</a><br/><p>Interesting comparison of the Nook Simple Touch next to the Kindle 3. Regardless of how much that keyboard sucks, typing on a soft keyboard on that device seems like it would suck more.  Still want to try one out.</p>
