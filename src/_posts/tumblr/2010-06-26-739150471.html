<p>British Petroleum’s well has been pouring thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for over a month, killing thousands of animals, and obliterating any sea life in its path. To make matters worse, there’s no end in sight.</p>

<p>MetaLab, Campaign Monitor, Squarespace, and WooThemes have come together to match donations to the National Wildlife Federation (up to $35,000).</p>

<p>These animals need our help. <a href="http://killspill.org/">Donate now</a>.</p>

<p>Definitely a need.  The pictures of this spill are heart wrenching.</p>
