<a href="http://guyinthechair.com/?p=515">TinyTLF</a><br/><p><a href="http://guyinthechair.com/">Paul Taylor</a> just released a new text layout framework, titled TinyTLF (not in any way related to Adobe&#8217;s TLF) that allows for a whole lot more control over things like real CSS in Flash, standards compliant XHTML display, lists and unordered lists, and background colors.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re building something with a need for some things that Adobe&#8217;s TLF does not quite provide, give this a shot, it looks brilliant.</p>
