<a href="http://www.juxtinteractive.com/blog/sustaining-engagement-in-online-communities/">Sustaining Engagement in Online Communities</a><br/><p>The company I work for, <a href="http://www.juxtinteractive.com/">jUXT Interactive</a>, just published a story on sustaining engagement in online communities after a project we just completed.  It&#8217;s over on <a href="http://www.juxtinteractive.com/blog">our blog</a>, and definitely has some interesting points.  Worth the read, go for it.</p>
