<p>VFX Supervisor Jose Ortiz recently <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/IRON-MAN-II-Molecule-Discovery-NEW/573381">posted his contribution to IRON MAN II</a> while working at <a href="http://prologue.com/">Prologue</a> in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The hologram needed to be an advanced piece of technology. This needed to be more refined than the original movie.  This was a very challenging shot due to its design process.  The molecule animation tied in the overall mood and feel. As the hologram look developed, it told the story.  The overall pipeline for the process was very clean and helped the shots come together for the film.</p>
