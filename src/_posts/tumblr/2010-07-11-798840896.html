<p class="MsoNormal">This identity for the City of Melbourne really caught my eye.<span> </span>More often than not, the brand identity for a city can end up looking dull and contrived, sometimes even too corporate.<span> </span>This identity is essentially for Melbourne’s council, but doesn’t look like a ‘typically boring’ council&#8230;</p>

<p>This is great stuff.  Doesn&#8217;t look municipal or governmental at all.  Super well done Melbourne.</p>
