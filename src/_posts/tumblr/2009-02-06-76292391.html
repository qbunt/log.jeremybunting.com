<a href="http://www.flashermag.com/">Flasher Magazine</a><br/><p>So, I know it&#8217;s not often I talk work on here, it&#8217;s mostly Stormtroopers driving Lotus Elises and things, but I&#8217;m going to talk work a bit.  For anyone interested in the Flash development scene/process, Flasher is a new video magazine dedicated to the Adobe Flash platform.  <a href="http://www.theflashblog.com">Lee Brimelow</a> and friends are producing this magazine and thus far, its been brilliant.  Highly recommended viewing.  Plus, there&#8217;s guns in this one!</p>
