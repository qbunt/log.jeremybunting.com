<p>In 1964, Lyndon Johnson needed pants, so he called the Haggar  clothing company and asked for some. The call was recorded (like all  White House calls at the time), and has since become the stuff of legend.  Johnson’s anatomically specific directions to Mr. Haggar are some of the most intimate words we’ve ever heard from the mouth of a President.</p>

<p>We at Put This On took <a href="http://whitehousetapes.net/clip/lyndon-johnson-joe-haggar-lbj-orders-some-new-haggar-pants">the historic original audio</a> and gave it to animator <a href="http://www.polymorphproductions.com/">Tawd Dorenfeld</a>, who created this majestic fantasia of bungholiana.</p>

<p>Enjoy this special treat from Put This On: <strong>LBJ Orders Pants. </strong>Then share it with a friend who loves pants.</p>
