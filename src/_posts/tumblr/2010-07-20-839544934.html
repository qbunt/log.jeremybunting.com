Oops. Basically, we shouldn't have to be any better than anyone else, because all phones suck.</dd><dt>Users:</dt><dd>But we're dropping calls.</dd><dt>Apple:</dt><dd>Yeah, but only one more than normal. So shut up.</dd><dt>Users:</dt><dd>Right, but when I'm talking to a client and--</dd><dt>Apple:</dt><dd>And look, we'll give you a Bumper for free. They're normally $29, but we're gonna make you schmucks happy and give you all a free one. That will solve this problem.</dd><dt>Users:</dt><dd>But you can't use the dock with a Bumper, and you can't use most of the car accessories with a Bumper, and the Bumper makes it hard to put the phone into your pocket which means you're more likely to drop it, and--</dd><dt>Apple:</dt><dd>Free Bumpers. Shut up.</dd><dt>Users:</dt><dd>Okay, what about the proximity sensor?</dd><dt>Apple:</dt><dd>Yeah, yeah. Stop complaining about that.

The iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market.</dd><dt>Users:</dt><dd>But what about--</dd><dt>Apple:</dt><dd>Did you see the fucking charts? Shut up.</dd></section></dialog>
