<a href="http://seancooke.com/blog/?p=403"><img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_kpd88dkiyA1qzr9k7o1_500.jpg"/></a><br/><p>An illustration done by buddy Sean Cooke, who runs <a href="http://seancooke.com/blog/?p=403">Through Thin and Thick</a> about myself, from days when we worked together.  The text may be kind of impossible to understand, as it is mostly an inside joke.  Thoroughly hilarious to me&#8230;.so I&#8217;m putting it up here.  Well done Sean, well done man.</p>
