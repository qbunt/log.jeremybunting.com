<p>Mozilla designer Stephen Horlander has posted some new <a href="http://blog.stephenhorlander.com/2010/04/20/theme-status-timelines-panels-and-progress/">detailed UI explorations</a> for Firefox. I still don’t care much for the aesthetics and the overall visual direction, but I absolutely love the amount of thought that Stephen and his team are putting into these issues and that they are so willing to share their design process.</p>

<p>All interesting thoughts here.  Great to see the design process for this stuff in the making.</p>
